pygtk-comics is a really simple GTK+ app which shows your favorite comics
on the desktop.

Right now it supports:

* Calvin and Hobbes
* XKCD

It is really simple to add another comic, you just need to specify the name,
author and a way to get the latest comic image url. Take a look at the code for
examples.
